=  Aegir hosted subsite
==================================================

This module plugs into the hosting module under hostmaster install profile
for the Drupal provisioning system Aegir. The module aims to address issues
raised in <http://groups.drupal.org/node/19006>.

The mechanisms in this module are relatively naive. The module takes advantage
of the existing Aegir architecture and does not alter the basic behaviour of
the Site feature (nor can it). Instead, it does three things:

 - Adds subsite management to the site edit form.
 - Hook onto provision_apache_vhost_config to add an Apache alias and database
   connection parameters to the parent vhost for the subsite.
 - Fire hosting tasks when subsite relationship changes occur.


 LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

The subsite management mentioned above is merely a means for pairing sites with
paths. As far as the module is concerned, it does not realise the pattern of
the subsite's domain name other than assume that the user has named the site in
such a way that Drupal loads the settings.php of that site correctly. An
example situation demonstrate a potential limit to this mechanism is
www.example.com/au being the same as www.example.com.au due to the way Drupal
searches the sites folder for settings. As Aegir prevents the creation of two
sites with identical domain names, it is impossible to even host the two
variants on separate platforms.
